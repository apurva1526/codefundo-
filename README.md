# Predict Natural Disasters caused by Plate Tectonic Movement

Surface of Earth cannot be considered one structure of mass but is a combination of plates. These plates are continuously sliding in the mantle inside Earth. These movements mostly are very slow and distributed over millions of years. But sometimes they might move abruptly with respect to each other and cause Natural Disasters like Earthquakes, Volacanoes and Seismic Sea Waves. 
Keeping this concept in mind we have come up with a methedology of predicting natural disasters of which data is available. Peter Bird from University of California in 2003 published the dataset on Tectonic Plates which we plan to take as an input to our model. The data about some natural disasters like Earthquake and Tsunami are collected from Kaggle.
Finally, with this data we want to apply Machine Learning Techniques to predict the location and time of Natural Disasters.
